# Getting Started

## Background

Searching.rocks is a fork of the original [Search.0t.rocks](#) codebase.

This version offers several enhancements over the original:
- **Enhanced Visuals:** Improved design and user experience.
- **User Accounts & Administration:** Includes an admin panel for managing user accounts.
- **Private Registrations:** Option to disable new registrations, making it easy to set up a private instance.
- **Modernized Libraries:** Updated dependencies and removal of obsolete packages.
- **Optimized Code Base:** The original code base was a rats nest but now it isn't!

## Planned Features

Weâ€™re continuously working on new improvements. Upcoming features include:
- **Advanced User Management:** Implementation of email password resets, TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password), and account limiting.
- **Stronger Authentication:** Hardening the user authentication API (further details are withheld for security reasons).

## Features Not on the Roadmap

- **Payment Portal:** There are no plans to integrate a payment system. If needed, feel free to implement your own solution when our API is further enhanced.
- **Pre-Acquired Data:** We do not include packaged data in this repository due to legal implications. Instead, we provide a fictitious example file to demonstrate the correct file format.
